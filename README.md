An Http request/response is the fundamantal communication process between a client and a server.

The status code I observed was 200, which means "OK." This indicates that the server successfully processed the request and returned the requested resource without any issues. ​

I learned about Git today is how to create and work with feature branches. ​ By creating a branch, making changes, and opening a Pull Request, I understood the importance of isolating changes for review before merging them into the main branch. ​
